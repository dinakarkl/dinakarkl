- 👋 Hi, I’m @dinakarkl
Rename utils.py to local_utils.py to avoid conflicit with default Python library utils.py.
Replace error index out of range to No License plate is founded!.
In case error No License Plate is founded! popped up, try to adjust Dmin from get_plate() function. Keep in mind that larger Dmin means more highly plate's information is lost.
